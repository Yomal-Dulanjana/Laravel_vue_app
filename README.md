# Laravel_vue_app

Laravel application seems to involve a Book Management System where users can perform various actions on books, such as adding, updating, deleting, and changing their type. You have controllers that handle these actions, services that manage the business logic, and potentially a facade that provides a convenient interface to interact with those services. Additionally, your application includes user authentication using the built-in Auth system provided by Laravel.
